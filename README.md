## General Info
A react application that allows the user to either pick from a drop down of subreddits or enter a subreddit of their own choosing and display the current hot post's titles as well as their score. The titles link to the original post on the Reddit website and the title above all of the posts links to the subreddit on the Reddit website. This introduced me to the React Framework and was my first major JavaScript project.
## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* React
* Fetch
* TailwindCSS
## Features
Currently implemented features:
* Ability to pick from chosen subreddits or type your own
* Can pick category of posts e.g. top, hot, new
* Clicking on the title takes you to the orignal post
* Displays current score of the post

Potential future features:
* Limit number of posts to display
* View text and comments of the post
## Inspiration
After completing a basic React tutorial I wanted to test my knowledge and decided to create a simple Reddit app.
## Status
Still expanding features, commits will be made when they are complete.
